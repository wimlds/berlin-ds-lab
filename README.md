## Goal

By the end of this lab you will have completed one data science project based on open data, simulating the work of a freelance data science team.

You will gain familiarity with processes and practice the required communication skills at the core of a data scientistâ€™s job. 

You will get experience with weekly planning, receiving and following guidance by professional data science tech leads, team collaboration, communication to stakeholders, documentation for project handover, sharing your ongoing work and working together on not-perfect code and ideas, peer 2 peer code review.

We are striving for a co-learning atmosphere. You will be part of a team of about four people, working together and learning from each other. Your mentors will check in with you weekly to make sure your team is on the right path.


## Real-world projects on real (and open) data

* Usage forecasting
* Resource prioritization
* Risk analysis
* Data journalism

Have a look at the projects folder. 

## Timeline

The mentorship consists of ~8 weeks, roughly following this structure:

Weeks 1-2: Kick-off, project introduction and ideation
Weeks 3-4: exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and baseline model
Weeks 5-6: feature construction and improved model
Weeks 7-8: Business presentation and technical handover


### Project introduction / ideation

You will get a brief by your (fake) client. Your task is to figure out what the client actually wants and convince them that *your* team is the right one to build the solution for them. 

* What is the problem they actually want solved?
* What positive impact could solving the problem have for them? 
* Who do you need to consider (users, other departments, employees, customers, etc) when defining the product?
* Describe the product/solution you are going to build for them.
* Identify how the solution integrates into the business/organization processes. Who uses it when and how.
* Identify KPIs for measuring your success.

You will present your results to the client and have the chance to ask additional questions about the business problem (reminder: client is fake and will be played by your mentors).

Next, very important step: translation from business problem to data science

* What kind of model are you going to build?
* How do the business KPIs you defined translate to actual data science metrics?


### Exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and baseline model

* Use whatever tools you like to explore the data. Find out, 
   	* Do you fully understand what each column means?
   	* Over what time range / region do you have data?
   	* Missing values / outliers?
	* Make some plots of the data distributions. Check if they are what you would expect.
	* Is there any other data set available somewhere that could make your data stronger? e.g. historic weather data, list of holidays, demographic / census data

* Data cleaning
       * You might decide to use only a subset of the data and, e.g. set aside some columns with sparse data for later use
       * Decide how to fill in missing values
       * Decide how to identify and handle outliers
 
* Define your evaluation procedure 
 
* Establish a baseline. This is the simplest model you can think of.

### Feature construction and improved model

* Experiment (in an organized manner) with:
    * different features
    * different models
    * different data improvement techniques
    
### Business presentation, and technical handover

todo

## Weekly calls

* First ~10 minutes: you present your work of the last week to us
* Rest: open discussion and plan next week
    * We want you to come with your own ideas for next steps, we are just there to give you some guidance on them.
    
## Presentation format

It is up to you who / how many people present

#### Client presentation

* You are presenting to the person who gave you the brief (played by your mentors)
* Don't make it too technical!
* Form: slides or similar

#### Technical presentation

* Show what your team did last week 
* Free form: slides, R/jupyter notebooks, tableau, write on whiteboard - whatever works for you

## Tools

* Project management: agile tool of your choice, e.g. trello
* Data exploration / visualisation: whatever you like
* Feature generation / modeling: python, R (decide within your team)
