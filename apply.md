# How to apply to WiMLDS Berlin Data Science Lab?

We are currently taking application for a new round of the lab to start in March 2021!

## Prerequisites

1. Must have some theoretical data science knowledge, i.e. taken some in-person/online classes or learned from books. You do not need to be an expert in data science, but you should be familiar with concepts such as feature engineering, classification vs regression models, train/test splitting, evaluation metrics.  
2. Must have some experience using R or python/scikit-learn for data science.
3. Recommended to have some familiarity with Git (for collaboration and showcasing your work), but it is not required to use GitHub to complete this project

## Time requirements

You should be available for two 1-hour calls/week over the course of 10 weeks. We will schedule these calls before the lab starts, so that you can plan ahead. 

In addition, you should expect 5-10 hours/week for working on the project (no fixed times, however fits your schedule). (Fair warning: some of our previous participants chose to invest more than 10 hours/week simply because they found the project engaging and wanted to progress further with their ideas.)

## Application process

After reading the [program description](README.md), if you wish to take part, please email us at __berlin-ds-lab@wimlds.org__ and describe how you meet the prerequisites. We’ve all had different data science journeys, you can share yours and give us links to relevant examples of previous work. If you prefer, we can also set up a video call instead, where you tell us about your experience in data science. 

__If you’re not sure if you “are good enough” please send us an email anyway. We have been teaching for years and know that most women and minorities students tend to underestimate themselves.__ 

Please note when you are generally available for weekly calls with the mentors and your team (day of the week, morning/afternoon/evening). We will later open a doodle if needed to confirm the final time slot. Participants will need to coordinate their collaboration times independently.  

Once we have a group of about 4 participants, we will send a final confirmation. By confirming your participation, you also agree to have your name and email shared with the mentors and other participants.
